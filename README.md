# Article-Activity-Visualizer
This project is a visualization dashboard built by leveraging D3.js. The data source for the project is a collection of around 1 million text articles (News, Blogs) stored in a JSON file.
The project has been undertaken in two stages:
- Data processing

DataPreProcessing.ipynb is a python notebook regarding the data processing steps undertaken during the development.

- Data visualization

The visualizations have been developed using HTMl, CSS and D3.js. Various primary Information Visualization concepts and theories have been incorporated in the desing of the dashboard.
This is the first iteration of the initial design plan for visualizing valuable information obtain from textual data analysis.

Dashboard screenshots are attached in the "Dashboard Demo".
